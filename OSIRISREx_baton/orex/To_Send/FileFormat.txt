Image_scene_info.txt file format:

element 1: image index
element 2-4: position of body relative to camera in camera frame [km]
element 5-13: rotation matrix from body frame to camera frame (first 3 values are the first row of the transformation matrix; every three is a row)
element 14-16: sun postion with respect to camera in camera frame [km]
element 17: calculated phase angle [degrees]
element 18-19: sun to object projected onto the image plane unit vector (you probably do not need)

General camera specs:
focal length: 630 mm
pixel pitch: 8.5 microns
sensor dimensions: 1024 x 1024

NOTE: I have to check with Andrew to make sure the camera specs are spot on.
